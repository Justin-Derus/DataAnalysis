NOTE: The original data set is taken from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ulrikthygepedersen/online-retail-dataset
<br/>
This original data set has been altered using AI - additional columns pertaining to location have been procedurally generated to accomplish the sole purpose of this data set of creating a heat map displaying where a business most recurring customers live/ make purchases from
<br/>
Original dataset/csv is "online_retail_original.csv", and the cleaned version that has had regions and cities added through the use of AI is "online_retail.csv"
The script that is used to create the new data set is called "cleanup.py", which makes use of NumPy and Pandas 
<br/>
This heat map was designed with the intent of helping board members or executives of a company determine where they want to put the focus of their company, including any upcoming areas that they are not heavily involved in yet
<br/>
In addition, another usage of this heatmap is for marketing teams. They can use this geographic data to determine where to most run an ad to either keep the existing customers coming back, or trying to place more emphasis on a region or city that they believe there is potential in.
