Q: Does the highest rated year fall into the highest rated decade?
<br/>A: No. The highest rated decade was the 90s while the highest rated individual year was in 1972

Q: As the years went on, did the average rating of the decades get higher? i.e. was there an upwards trend as time went on?
<br/>A: According to the unweighted trend line, there was a slight upwards trend over time. However, this does not account for the amount of movies per year (A decade with 6 movies is just as important as a decade with 47 movies, the trend line will NOT be pulled closer to the decades with lots of movies, which means it will not be more representative of the bulk data) This is good for an overall trend if we do not care about the number of movies in a decade.

Q: As the years went on, and we track the weight of how many movies are in the decade, what is the trend?
<br/>A: There is still an overall trend upwards in terms of the average rating, but with the weight added, the trend slows down and is getting closer to not having a trend at all. Since the 1990s to 2010s has way more movies than the 1920s and 1930s, it should be weighed more and the overall trend should be pulling a bit more towards those decades (The trend line tilts toward the high-count decades, and the low-count decades do not distort the overall trend as much). <br/>Sayings that are representative of these trends: "I care more about what most movies are doing, rather than a decade with only a few movies", "Show me the trend where most of the movies actually are".
